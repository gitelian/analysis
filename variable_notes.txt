### single value variables ###
### OR single lists NOT the same length as total trials ###
chan_per_shank: number of channels there are per shank (LFP analysis only)

depths: estimated depth of all units

last_engaged_trial: last trial mouse was performing task

lfp_t: timestamps corresponding to each LFP sample

min_tbefore_stim: time to analyze before trial line goes HIGH

min_tafter_stim: time to analyze after trial line goes HIGH

num_good_trials: num trials / stimulus condition considered good (e.g. ran)
    (i.e. run_boolean, wsk_boolean)
num_slow_trials: num_trials / stimulus condition when mouse ran below threshold
    or did not whisk
num_all_trials: num_trials / stimulus condition

run_t: timestamps corresponding to each running velocity sample

t_after_stim: time between trial line goes HIGH and the BEGINNING of the
    analysis period (i.e. time to SKIP)

wtt: timestamps corresponding to each whisker tracking sample



### CREATED by "rates()"  ###
### list of lists [trial type][trial index] ###

   ### spikes
abs_rate, abs_count, evk_rate, evk_count: spike counts or rates during
    specified window

binned_spikes: number of spikes per bin

psth: smoothed PSTH

psth_t: LIST time stamps for each time bin

   ### behavior
binds: behavior ids

licks: lick times

lick_bool: whether mouse licked (either engaged/ran trials or all trials,
        depends on the parameters set in rates(params))

trial_choice: did mouse make correct decision



### array variables ###
lfp_data: blah blah blah
run_boolean: True/False did mouse run self.trial_class['run_boolean']

run_data: _run_min_samp x trials, velocity per trial

wt_data: _wt_min_samp x 7 x trials, whisker tracking data per trial (angle,
        set-point, amplitude, phase, velocity, whisking, curvature)



### List variables (value / trial) ###
correct_list: did mouse make correct choice

behavior_ids: numerical value indicating 'hit', 'miss', 'false alarm',
    'correct reject')

behavior_labels: dictionary, behavior_ids are keys to the names in dict

good_trials: True/False, skip trial if False

licks_all: 0/1 did mouse lick

stim_ids_all: list of stimulus IDs / trial | self.stim_ids_all

trial_class: whether mouse ran ('run_boolean') or mouse was engaged
             ('jb_engaged'), Dictionary containing lists
